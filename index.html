                Dear Munni,<br>
                <br>

From the moment we met, my life has been filled with joy and love beyond anything I ever imagined. 🌟 Your kindness, your laughter, and the way you light up every room with your presence have made me a better person. 💖 <br>
<br>
Every day with you feels like a beautiful adventure, and I find myself cherishing every moment we share. 🥰 The little things, like our quiet talks and our shared dreams, mean the world to me. 🌈 Your support and understanding have been a guiding light, and I can’t imagine my future without you by my side. 🌠<br>
<br>
Today, I want to take a step forward in our journey together. I want to build a future with you, filled with endless love and happiness. 🏡💑 You are my soulmate, my confidant, and my greatest love. I am completely and utterly devoted to you. ❤️<br>
<br>
With all my heart, I ask you this: Mohua, will you accept me? 💍 I promise to stand by you through every challenge, celebrate with you in every joy, and love you more deeply with each passing day. 🌟 I look forward to a lifetime of adventures, laughter, and unwavering support with you. 🌟<br>
<br>
Forever and always,<br>
