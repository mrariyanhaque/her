            <p>From the moment we met, my life has been filled with joy and love beyond anything I ever imagined. Your kindness, your laughter, and the way you light up every room with your presence have made me a better person.

Every day with you feels like a beautiful adventure, and I find myself cherishing every moment we share. The little things, like our quiet talks and our shared dreams, mean the world to me. Your support and understanding have been a guiding light, and I can’t imagine my future without you by my side.

Today, I want to take a step forward in our journey together. I want to build a future with you, filled with endless love and happiness. You are my soulmate, my confidant, and my greatest love. I am completely and utterly devoted to you.

With all my heart, I ask you this: Mohua, will you accept me?

I promise to stand by you through every challenge, celebrate with you in every joy, and love you more deeply with each passing day. I look forward to a lifetime of adventures, laughter, and unwavering support with you.
